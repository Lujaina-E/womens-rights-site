TODO
- change the design of gallery to reflect articles, each witha specific border and in an orderly scroll fashion
- edit all other pages like the founder page ... better styling
- gallery form works... (http error 405)
- Shove in a bit of JS   ===> NAVBAR (decent design)
- nicer presentation of pages from index (today)
