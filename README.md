# Sample-Website
//rewrite this later...



TODO
- change the design of gallery to reflect articles, each corresponding to own page.
- get the website deployed...github pages? aws? idk just make it accessibel and with a link on this page. 
- edit all other pages but the founder page to be better styling
- get a CSS file rather than styling inline
- get a form for inputting ideas for other female known people to put up in the gallery
