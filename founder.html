<h3>I am an advocate for women's
rights and hope that this website will do a number of things for the community,
including educating women, men, boys and girls about the inequalities that women
have to suffer simply because of their gender and what to do to combat these
stereotypes, give insight into what toxic masculinity is and how that plays a role
in suppressing women, and how women is STEM are the ground-breaking future of
breaking stereotypes around women. </h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">This photo was taken in Cairo, Egypt, at the sunset form a neighbourhood compound. It captures the subtly calming and cozy energy. I especially like this
photo because s a contry in the Middle East, it is often overlooked as a country in poverty or a country whose only contribution to society is producing terrorists.
I think it is important to capture the life that Egypt actually is, and to, again, provide some perspective from a seemingly normal moment in the peaceful evening
to those who seem to be fixated on their image of my home country. </p>

<img style="width: 300px; length: 300px;"src="sp2.jpg" alt="A second picture of my work. You are experiencing a loading error, please stand by and check connection">

<p style="font-size: 16px;">This second photo, I had taken last year during a road trip to Montana, America. Though not focussing on my theme of 'perspective' much, I enjoyed editting this
photo as it had shone through with many of the pretty colours that I would have never so vibrantly noticed before. The purpose of this photo being chosen as a
representation for the rest fof my work is because of that fact itself. That when I editted my work and saw that the colors changed and the colours within the
pebbles in the river turned shimmering hues of blues and pinks, I couldn't help but wonder how mnay people had overlooked this beauty. The colours weren't added
with my editing, I simply applied filters to bring out certain colours over the rest. My choosing to focus on the colours of tones within a peacfully running stream,
I was able to make that the centrepeice of the photorgaph. Similarly to the issue of women's rights, wth all the global issues happening in the world right now,
the issues with gender equality seem minor, or less important. To that, I disagree completely. I say that wit all the issues in the world right now,wehould
address all of them! I recognize that there are many non-prot organizations much more intensely focussed on each of these issues, gender equality included.
But with the sheer amount of people that are concerned about these humanitarian crises, <b>it still is NOT ENOUGH.</b> There are still people who are not educated
in the world, and like the stones in the river, we need to sharpen our focus and filter our work to focus to educating and spreading this critical knowdledge
to everyone so that each person can have an impact. The power of one is limited, but the power of many combined is overpowering. Any system can be overthrown
and any revolution and change of societal values can be changed if enough people are educated and enough people care to make a change, so we all must focus on
educating, regardless of how repetitve it may seem to do so. </p>
