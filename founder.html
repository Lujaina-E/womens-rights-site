<h3>I am an advocate for women's
rights and hope that this website will do a number of things for the community,
including educating women, men, boys and girls about the inequalities that women
have to suffer simply because of their gender and what to do to combat these
stereotypes, give insight into what toxic masculinity is and how that plays a role
in suppressing women, and how women is STEM are the ground-breaking future of
breaking stereotypes around women. </h3>

<p style="clear: both;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The first photo was taken in Cairo, Egypt, at the sunset form a neighbourhood compound. It captures the subtly calming and cozy energy. I especially like this
photo because as a country in the Middle East, it is often overlooked as a contribution to global poverty. I think it is important to capture the life that Egypt actually is, and to, again,
provide some perspective from a seemingly normal moment in the peaceful evening to those who seem to be fixated on their image of my home country. </p>
