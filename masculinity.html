        <section>
            <h2 class="sectionHeader">What is Toxic masculinity?</h2>
            <p>Though not directly related to feminism, toxic masculinity refers to the cultural norm that is associated with the idea
            that men are harmful to the society we live in and themselves. The reciprocation of gender norms onto the image of men has
            been one of 'toxic masculinity,' that men aren't allowed to express their feelings and that they can only pursue 'manly'
            jobs and other norms I've sure you have heard of. The simple truth is, gender norms have potential to harm the women of
            our society just as much as the do men. For a women to be trapped within the normality that she should <b>want</b> to
            only pursue feminine and dainty jobs, that effect is the same for men! That expectation for them to want to go into positions
            of leadership in our society instead of caring for children, or maybe expressing themselves a different way than masculinity
            suggests, that is just as toxic as the stereotypes that women face!</p><hr>

        <section>
            <h2 class="sectionHeader">Why is this related to feminism?</h2>
            <p>The problem here is, however, that when discussing feminism,  men are commonly painted as wrong-doers (and some of them
            actively are!) but we have to remmeber that as the fundamental duty of feminism is uprooting gender norms, it is a war between
            women and men against gender norms and stereotypes, rather than women against men. Femnisim can only be solved when these norms
            of what a women is capable of and what a man is capable of are eradicated, because when it comes down to it at the end of the
            day, feinsim is a fight for equalism. A fight for women to be considered equal to men, and that calls out to the women who
            feel as though they are pushed into the claustrophobic walls of what generation after generatio not only expectstem to fulfill,
            but to do nothing else, as much as it calls out the men who feel trapped for the same reason. The reason toxic masculinity is
            so important in the fight for eqality -or feminism, is because toxic masculinity is to be solved with the same mechanism that
            will solve feminism, meaning that the fight for feminism is a two way fight tht includes both men and women as they both
            pursue an equal ground where they can pursue whatever their heart desires.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="sectionHeader"> What can we do about toxic masculinity?</h2>
            <p>If toxic masculinity is something that personally impacts you, I would say to advocate for your rights, similar to what feminists
            advocate for. If this is something you have only been brought into the light of today, as a woman likely, then I would take this
            opportunity to relfect on what feminism means for women, and what it means for men. What the reality of feminism actually comes down
            to, and why it is so important to remember that when we discuss feminism, we remember that <b>the war for feminism is not against
            men, it is rather against those who are trying to preserve the gender norms</b>, which is normally for selfish reasons.</p>
