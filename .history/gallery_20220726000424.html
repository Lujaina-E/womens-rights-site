                Named as one of Forbes' 200 Most Powerful Arab Women in 2014, Princess 
                Reema continues to build on her long list of achievements. Last year, she
                was appointed as Saudi Arabia's first female ambassador to the United
                States. Weeks later, the royal was tapped to head the Gulf country's
                newly-established Special Olympics Federation. For decades, Her Royal 
                Highness has been shattering glass ceilings and pushing boundaries for 
                Saudi women across the Kingdom. In July 2020, she became the first Saudi woman to be appointed to the International Olympics Committee.</p>

            <p class="person-info">Egyptian squash player Nour El Sherbini became the first woman to win the Tournament of Champions 
                three timesâ€”and she's not yet 30. The Egyptian athlete is no stranger to
                 making sports history. In 2009, she became the youngest world champion in 
                 the history of the sport when she won the women's title at the World Junior
                  squash Championships at just nine years old. In 2015, she became the 
                  youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship, which was held in 
                  Malaysia, and then a year later retained her title by beating her most 
                  recent opponent, El Welily, at the Women's World Championship held in El 
                  Gouna, Egypt.</p>

            <p class="person-info">After winning the race in Michigan, Rashida Tlaib, who ran as a
                 Democrat, now fills the seat formerly occupied by Michigan Democratic Rep.
                  John Conyers, making history as the first Muslim woman in Congress. The 
                  daughter of Palestinian immigrants, Tlaib ran unopposed on the general 
                  election ballot following her primary win. The 44-year-old Detroit-born 
                  Democrat, who served in Michigan's state legislature from 2009 to 2014 
                  before working as an attorney, is also known for disrupting a speech given
                   by then-presidential nominee Donald Trump. She further made headlines
                    when she decided to wear a traditional Palestinian thobe from her
                     motherland when she was sworn into the House of Representatives.</p>
