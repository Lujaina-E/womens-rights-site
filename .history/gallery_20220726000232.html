                States. Weeks later, the royal was tapped to head the Gulf country's
                newly-established Special Olympics Federation. For decades, Her Royal

            <img class="galleryPhoto" src="Pictures/nour.jpg" alt="A picture of Nour">
            <p class="person-info">Egyptian squash player Nour El Sherbini became the first woman to win the Tournament of Champions 
                three timesâ€”and she's not yet 30. The Egyptian athlete is no stranger to
                 making sports history. In 2009, she became the youngest world champion in 
                 the history of the sport when she won the women's title at the World Junior
                  squash Championships at just nine years old. In 2015, she became the 
                  youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship, which was held in 
                  Malaysia, and then a year later retained her title by beating her most 
                  recent opponent, El Welily, at the Women's World Championship held in El 
                  Gouna, Egypt.</p>

            <img class="galleryPhoto" src="Pictures/greta.jpg" alt="A picture of Greta Thunberg">
            <p class="person-info">A mere 17 year old Swedith activist, Greta Thunberg inspired and brought forth much of the global
            issues surrounding climate change to light, earning herself the Right Livelihood award, also known as
            the alternate Nobel Peace Prizem and other prestigious awards. Having addressed the UN on the topic
            of ugrent matter of climate change, Great has faced much support from millions around the world,
            initating and inspiring mnay climate strikes. She is an inspiration to all those who pursue a cleaner
            Earth and are putting forth all efforts towards the climate change crisis. However, recalling Donald
            Trump's tweet regarding Greta suggesting that she needs to "chill and watch a good old-fashioned movie
            with a friend," himsef and many political leaders in our society view her as a danger to society ,
            likely because of the impact she has had on the world and the power she has exerted. Greta shows us that
            <b>being a girl or being a youth doesn't invalidate our ideas</b>, and that passion and that drive to seek
            change in the worldwill be rewarded with promising results. She can be reached on Instagram through her
            account @gretathunberg</p>
