            <h2 class="heads">What ARE gender norms? And why do they exist?</h2>
                <p><b>Gender norms</b> are stereotypes surrounding what a man or women typically is supposed to, or is entitled to do. As defined by the free Dictionary, gender norms are "the
                overtexpression of attitudes that indicate to others the degree of your maleness or femaleness " in today's spciety based on tradition. Simply, the fact that pink is for girls
                and blue is for boys are gender norms, and that women are expected to stay in the house and clean while men go out and work for the family's wealth. ALthough those may obviosuly
                look to be very traditionl worldviews that or world has clearly moved on from, we see gender norms in modern day society: when women get catcalled on the street, or the gender
                wage gap that many companies face legal issues due to. Though it may seem that these behaviours aren't directly derived from the applications of gender norms, a closer look can
                show to just how much these traditional ideas, regardless of how wrong and outdated they may seem, still exist in today's world. These normse have existed in ancient civilizations,
                dating all the way back to Greek and Roman civilizations, when woman would stay at home and tend to the house and children and men would be allowed to leave the house to go to
                their jobs, enjoy activities for leisure, and to voice political concerns. These norms have been passed down from one generation to the next, through cultures and religions, until
                it naturally came to every generation that there are certain roles for a woman and a man to fulfill, and these rules cannot be bent.</p>
            <h2 class="heads"> How are these gender norms detrimental to our society?</h2>
                <p>The reason that gender norms are such a huge conlfict when discussing equalism in today's world is that those gender norms and <U>OUTDATED</U> stereotypes have become the new normal
                and the constant belittiling of women in society is something that isn't a new idea; this traditional beleief is somehing that everyone's brains are wired to. Women cannot expect to
                make a change in this world while being viewed as equal to man when everyone's idea of women is tinted ever so differently due to those gender norms. It is so important for girls
                <b>as well as boys</b> grow up surrounded with leaders and role models that are both women and men in order to help eradicate these less than idealistic views. For a small girl
                in elemtary school to grow up beleiving that she is exected to grow up and take care of a household and do nothing more, that is demeaning to her morals and that is telling her
                that her ideas, her values, and her as a person, means less than those of her classmate simply because she is a girl and he is a boy. This makes her feel less worthy than another
                person who has just the same amount of potential as, if not more. The problem with marginalizing women because of their supposed "femininity" is that it lead to a lack of inovation,
                and decisions made in society are less comprehensive. With 50% of the population deemed unfit to explore the world of science, technology, engineering, and math and instead told that
                their usefulness comes from keeping the house spotless and cooking meals all day, that will account to less technological advancement. Because the men in those fields would obviously wish to
                constantly have more advancements in the field, this can only mean that they do not want women to have succeses because they beleive that their are more worthy than a women and they are scared
                that a women could actually be more innovative and thoughtful than them, which only hurts their ago because again, of that unpsoken but known gender norm that <b>a women cannot be better than
                you as a man</b>. As well, decisions made in society are engineered to maintain this system of patriarchy, where women are constantly beng pushed into the limiting space  that is women stereotypes.</p>
            <h2 class="heads">What can we do about these gender norms to fix the problem?</h2>
                <p>The solution to this problem comes from focussing on female leaders and female successes in the world of politics, STEM, medicine, and other humanitarian endeavours as a short term solution
                to inspire other women in today's society that the world isn't completely shtting them out, and all it takes is their own passion and someone who is filling to fight their way to the top in order
                to succeed. Sure, there will be struggles and there will be men who are terrfied of having a women surpass them in success, as the stereotype told them that they are, by default, more honourable than
                women, but that will only get in the way as much as she lets it. As a long term solution, educating the young and bringing them up in a more equlizing manner that is in acceptance and that
                focusses on the indivdual's thoughts and potential rather than whether they are a boy or a girl will help eradicate this demeaning way of thinking and bring forth a generation that is completely cleaned of
                constant pursuit and satisfaction of gender norms.</p>

    <i>The only fear a women can have from success is one that society pressured her to instill on herself.</i>
