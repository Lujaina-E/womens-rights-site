    <h1 style="color: skyblue;"> Here are a bunch of links to helpful TED-Ed talks that further discuss these very pressing issues!</h1> <hr>
    <img style ="width: 450px; length: 450px;"src="women.jpg" alt="Please stand by. Your computer is experiencing some loading issues, refresh the page and retry">

    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This link puts the question out here and discusses the question that at least most of us on this website have thought abot once or twice: is
        feminism actually that good of a movement? Thsi speaker discusses how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgIgytWyo_A"> feminsim might
        actually be underminimg itself</a>, digging a whole further down into itself rather than trying to pull out of the hole with a solution.
        This sensation comes from the fact that in a sense of trying to find and fight for equality and a sense of power for all women, many
        individuals become violent verbally and ideologically towards men, whihc undermines the whole movement.
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        THINK NEW ZEALAND! This link addresses the seemingly taboo but very blatantly obvious fact that few female leaders in the world. Why is
        this so? What cold we accomplish if more women were in higher positions of authority? All of these are questions that this video touches
        on, so if you're wodnering how eminsim takes its place in the political world and why it's even more of an important issue to discuss there,
        then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18uDutylDa4"> this is the video you want to watch</a>. This will prompt you to think about all
        the decisions that men in politics have taken, and besides the fact that it is seemingly unbalnced to have that many men na room decide
        what is best for the whole of society, women included, the decisions could be based one way or another, leaving out some groups or thinkng
        in mind of only a specific group.
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This video isn't the typical video that convinces you of becoming a feminist through stats about how many women are being verbally abused
        in the workplace or the gender gap when it comes to the salaries at seemingy equal jobs, or any of the things most of evryone has heard of
        before. Instead, this video discusses the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18uDutylDa4">feminist paradox</a> that comes with adopting
        this very victimzing set of values. This video EXCELLENTLY speaks out to those who are concerned that the aggresssive form of feminism that
        is currently trending in the world and showing how that, again, will act counterproductive in what was initatlly intended to be a "fight for
        equality between men and women." This one is definitely a good watch for those who wish to pursue <b>feminsim</b> but also don't want to go
        overboard with it and eventually become <b>anti-man.</b>
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This link is actually very interesting, becasue it addresses the people who don't consider themselves feminists, and asks why. Why is
        it that you aren't a feminist, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLkwuMu9OaA">what is it about your ideologies that makes you
        against this movement</a>. And finally, is not defining oneself as a feminist really as sexist as modern day society makes it seem? Or
        is it a more rational way of thinking that isn't selectively victimizng 50% of the world's population over the other?
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This last link is one that I feel is the most important one of all. If you don't have time to watch
        all the rest, this is the one that you want to be watching. In 14short minutes, this speaker will disucss with you
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5mionzBMlA&t=156s"> what feminism really is</a>, and why it's so important for
        us to actually, fully undertsand what is meant by it when someone calls themselves part of this monumental movement, and leaves
        us to ponder whether it is actually what we want for the world and future generations.
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This link discusses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc"> why <b>everyone should be a feminist</b>
        </a> and it's definietly worth the watch if you're over the edge about what the commonly used phrase "I'm a
        feminist" actually means and refers to.
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
            This one is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6ufvYWTqQ0"> another link about why everyone sould be a feminist.</a>
            It discusses how feminism is actually equalism, and what that means for everyone in an ideal world.
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This link discusses what<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGei_hbF5Sw">"gender equality"<i>actually</i> is
        </a> and how it's different from the necessarily spoken <i>"feminists."</i>
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This third link discusses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY&t=732s"> the trend that feminists have
        subconsciously started taking actually is</a> and why feminism necessarily as it is currently seen in the
        world isn't what it should be, taking a turn into what I like to call <i>toxic feminsim.</i>
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This link here is one of my favourites as it discusses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cetg4gu0oQQ"> toxic masculinity</a>,
        as issue that is often overlooked when discussing feminism.
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
        This link discusses future generations and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmG4fkmGPd8">what we should teach children about
        feminism</a>. Spoken about by a 17 year old writer, this video is touching in all the ways that leaves u wanting to make a change on
        this Earth.
