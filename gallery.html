        <h3 style="color: indianred;">DR. MERRITT MOORE</h3> <hr>
        <img style="width: 300px; length: 300px;" src="Pictures/merritt.jpg" alt="A picture of Dr. Merritt Moore">
        <p>A "quantum ballerina" as she calls herself, Dr. Merritt Moore shattered steroetypes in the
        scientific world by pursuing both her passions: quantum physics as well as pursuing
        profesional ballet. After studying Physics at Harvard University and graduating with honours,
        she got her PhD in Atomic and Laser Physics from the University of Oxford. Recently having been
        awarded as a Forbes 30 under 30 recipient, she is currently working on creating and choreographing
        a ballet duet between an industrial robotics arm and a human dancer. She is famously knwon for
        being a part of several national ballet companies, as well as her doctorate degree. For
        someone, let alone a women, to so succesfully connnect the two world of dance and science, Dr.
        Moore stands as an excellent role model for young girls who are conflicted with their passions
        due to the stereotypes of what a girl should and shouldn't do, and just how much she can
        accomplsih if she sets her mind to what her passions truly are, at heart. On Instagram, she
        can be reached at @PhysicsonPointe </p>
        <h3 style="color: indianred;">MALALA YOUSAFZAI</h3><hr>
        <img style="width: 300px; length: 300px;" src="Pictures/malala.jpg" alt="A picture of Malala Yousafzai">
        <p>As the story is well known, Malala stood up on a bus to actively protest against a taliban
        that demanded children couldn't be educated. Her survival of this assasination attempt when they
        shot her and her refusal to give up on the topic of children's education as a basic human right
        earned her a Noble Peace Prize in recognition of her efforts. A now graduate of Oxford in Philosophy,
        Politics, and Economy, Malala is famous in the world for demonstarting that bravery is a mindset and
        that pursuig what oneself thinks above all else is the only way to eradicate ethical wrongdoings. She
        taught not only young girls, but everyone around the world, that age is simply no excuse to tackle
        on the issues of this world. She can be reached on Instagram at @malala </p>
        <h3 style="color: indianred;">GRETA THUNBERG</h3><hr>
        <img style="width: 300px; length: 300px;" src="Pictures/greta.jpg" alt="A picture of Greta Thunberg">
        <p>A mere 17 year old Swedith activist, Greta Thunberg inspired and brought forth much of the global
        issues surrounding climate change to light, earning herself the Right Livelihood award, also known as
        the alternate Nobel Peace Prizem and other prestigious awards. Having addressed the UN on the topic
        of ugrent matter of climate change, Great has faced much support from millions around the world,
        initating and inspiring mnay climate strikes. She is an inspiration to all those who pursue a cleaner
        Earth and are putting forth all efforts towards the climate change crisis. However, recalling Donald
        Trump's tweet regarding Greta suggesting that she needs to "chill and watch a good old-fashioned movie
        with a friend," himsef and many political leaders in our society view her as a danger to society ,
        likely because of the impact she has had on the world and the power she has exerted. Greta shows us that
        <b>being a girl or being a youth doesn't invalidate our ideas</b>, and that passion and that drive to seek
        change in the worldwill be rewarded with promising results. She can be reached on Instagram through her
        account @gretathunberg</p>
        <h3 style="color: indianred;">MARIE CURIE </h3><hr>
        <img style="width: 300px; length: 300px;" src="Pictures/marie_curie.jpg" alt="A phto of Madame Marie Curie">
        <p>Taking a delve into history, Madame Curie spent her life working with radioactive chemicals, and
        unfortunately died too young. A two-time winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in Physics and
        Chemistry, Curie was the first single woamn to win a Nobel Prize, not to mention the only woman to
        date to have won the prize in two different fields. Her achievements include the discovery of Polonium
        and later Radium, and her discovery of the phenomenom of radioactivity in primarly Uranium. In the
        midst of her work, she gave birth to two daughters, and did not let that interrupt her intensive
        scientific work. Upon the hard hit blow of the death of her husband, she struggled but eventually
        continued leading her work, eventually isolating radium and winning hersecond Nobel Prize. Her story
        is one of ambition and defiance, that devotion to science and one's passions are not to be short-handed
        because of the limits of possibility; she shattered steerotypes for women in the scientifc world. Her
        impact on STEM is greatly appreciated and honoured in both Chemistry and Physics, and the two elements
        she discovered honour her and her legacy of determination. She is an inspiration to yong girls that
        nothing stands in the way of you and your dreams, and women are no less capable than men in the
        stream of STEM.</p>
        <h3 style="color: indianred;">WHITNEY WOLFE</h3><hr>
        <img style="width: 300px; length: 300px;" src="Pictures/whitney.jpg" alt="A phto of whitney wolfe">
        <p>After her dissatisfaction with Tinder after she was sexually haraassed while holding the title of
        Vice President of Marketing with the compnay, Whitney sued the company for discrimination and turned to
        entrepreneurship to satisfy the vision that she had for an online dating application and company, which
        was a woman-centric app to focus on positivity and building up one another. So that's exactly what
        she did: she founded the app Bumble, which is different than other dating applications in that women have
        to reach out first, which was seen as a precedented move in the dating world. Not only daring, it was
        extremely successful- the app now has 30 million users. Her success can be seen to young girls through her
        initiative to leave Tinder when she was in a relatively powerful position and go her own way because she
        wasn't respected enough at first. That women are not to use their voices and are instead told that they
        have to listen and agree with everything that a man says, that is disrespectful, and Whitney was not
        going to stand that. Going one's own way, especially as a woman, has so much potential for success and
        we do not need a man to reach her envisionment of a better world. Women have a voice, and they can
        contribute themselves to society. She can be reached on Instagram @whitney</p>
        <h3 style="color: indianred;">PRINCESS DIANA</h3><hr>
        <img style="width: 300px; length: 300px;" src="Pictures/diana.jpg" alt="A phto of the late princess">
        <p>Unlike the rest of these inspirations, the late Princess Diana didn't build her way up to entrepreneurial
        success, and the wasnt a wonder in sny of the STEM fields...but the reason thatis up on the gallery is that
        she held true to her values during her lifetime, even as a member of the royal family, and she pursued what
        being what a true 'leader' meant to her rather than simply followig alog with what the rest of the royl family
        insisted on. As a young mother to Prince Harry and Prince William, she was always nvlved in the lives of her
        children, and often did things that broke the rules of what a member of what a rpincess should do, for example
        she particiapted in the Mother's day race at Prince Harry's school event, proving that she saw that she was
        just a mom to Harry, and like all moms should do for their sons, she mae him proud my winning the race.
        Diana believed that a leader is not by title, but rather by the ability to be liked enough by the people for
        them to instinctively follow. This made her ofte get into trouble with the royal family's rules, but for Diana,
        she wanted to be loved by the people. In beleieving that a leader should delegate the people and not enforce
        anything upon them, unlike those surrounding her within the royal castle's walls, she become loved by the
        general public, as she was more than an individual  with the luxuries of living royal. She was simply one
        of them, and that humanity that she displayed towards the general public earned her that leadership title
        beyond ay of the other royals. She was unstoppable as a force of kindness and love for her people, and she paved
        the way for what true leadership looks like, royalty or not. May she rest in peace.</p>
